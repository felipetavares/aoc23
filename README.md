# Advent of Code 2023
## Typed Python Edition

Beyond having fun, my main goal for this year is to do it with strongly typed
python where possible.

With Python 3.11 and 3.12 there are quite a few new interesting typing features
so I will be exploring those where feasible in the initial days.

As we get past day 10 or so I might change my approach since just getting the
correct answer will be the priority.

```shell
cd <day>
pyright <file>.py
pytest <file>.py
python <file>.py
```

Have fun folks!

## Note on Inputs

All the solutions expect a file called `input` (e.g.: `1/input`). They are not
pushed to the repo according to AoC etiquette. You can download your own and put
them in the appropriate directories if you want to check solutions.
